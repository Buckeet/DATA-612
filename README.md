# DATA-612
Data Mining Homework

**Assignment 3:** The dataset contains home game data for MLB ballparks including first home game of the years, last home game of the year, and yearly attendance.
In the assignement, I imported pandas and the csv file I was working with. I checked the data types and converted the column I was using into datatime data. 
I substracted this maximum date from all other dates in the last home game column and created a new column with that that data. The data in that column was in days. 
I converted days to months and created a new column for months. Then, I saved the new csv file.

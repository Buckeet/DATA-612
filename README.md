# DATA-612
**Data Mining Homework**

**Assignment 3:** Used pandas to manipulate a csv file and create new columns of data. I use MLB home game data for this assignment

**Assignment 4**: Used matplot and seaborn libraries in Python to create charts for univariate and bivarate data. The data is MLB batting statistics. I use hits and strike outs for this assignment.

**Assignment 5:** Used pandas and numpy libaries to merge datasets, locate missing values, and replace missing values with data.
